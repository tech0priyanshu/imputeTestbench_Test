## Feature Suggestion: Data Visualization in Shiny Dashboard for imputeTestbench

###  Introduction 
#### The imputeTestbench package is designed to evaluate and compare different data imputation methods. Currently, users can only rely on statistical outputs to understand the impact of these methods. To enhance the user experience, I propose adding a Shiny dashboard that visually showcases data both before and after imputation. This feature will help users intuitively grasp how missing data is handled and how imputation methods influence their datasets.

### Why We Should Implement This Feature  

- **Clearer Understanding:** Visualizing missing data and imputed values helps users intuitively grasp how imputation methods affect their data.  
- **Better Comparisons:** Interactive plots allow side-by-side comparisons of multiple imputation methods.  
- **User Engagement:** An interactive Shiny dashboard makes the package more user-friendly and accessible.  
- **Data Transparency:** Visualizing data transformations (raw to imputed) builds trust in the applied methods.

###  How It Would Work  

- **Data Input:** Users upload datasets through the Shiny interface.  
- **Pre-Imputation Visualization:** Histograms, scatter plots, and box plots highlight missing data points.  
- **Imputation Method Selection:** Dropdown menu for selecting imputation methods (mean, median, kNN, etc.).  
- **Post-Imputation Visualization:** Plots display data after imputation for direct before-and-after comparisons.  
- **Before and After Comparison Page:** Side-by-side visualizations with toggle options for different imputation methods, using synchronized plots.  
- **Metrics Display:** Summary statistics (mean, median, standard deviation) for both raw and imputed data.  
- **Interactivity:** Hover tooltips for data insights and zoom functionalities for detailed exploration.

### Impact of This Feature  

- **Enhanced Decision-Making:** Helps users choose the best imputation method for their datasets.  
- **Increased Package Adoption:** An intuitive, visually appealing dashboard attracts more users to *imputeTestbench*.  
- **Improved Analysis:** Allows researchers to spot trends or inconsistencies, boosting model performance and insights.

### Conclusion 
Integrating a Shiny dashboard into imputeTestbench would elevate the package by providing an intuitive, interactive way to visualize data before and after imputation. This feature bridges the gap between statistical outputs and visual insights, making the imputation process more transparent and user-friendly.
Looking forward to feedback on this proposal and discussing how we can best integrate it into the package!
