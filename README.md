# imputeTestbench_Test 
## 1. Easy Test:
  Running imputeTestbench on Time Series
  Task: Use imputeTestbench on a real time series and document the results.
  
  What I did: Ran imputation on the nottem dataset using na.locf method, testing with 10-30% missing data. Printed results without errors.
## 2. Medium Test: Feature Suggestion
  Task: Propose a new feature for imputeTestbench.
  
  What I did: Suggested adding a Shiny dashboard for visualizing data before and after imputation, allowing method comparisons and interactive exploration.
## 3. Hard Test: New Function Implementations
  Task: Implement five new imputation functions.
  
  What I did: Created dummy implementations for arithmetic mean, geometric mean, harmonic mean, mode, and median. Ensured tests passed without errors or warnings.
