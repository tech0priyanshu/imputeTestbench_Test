# Hard Test: New Function Implementations
 ## Task
 Implement five new imputation functions for the imputeTestbench package.

## Solution
I developed dummy implementations for the following imputation methods:

### Arithmetic Mean (AM) 
 Calculates the sum of all values divided by their count.
### Geometric Mean (GM) 
  Computes the nth root of the product of all values.
### Harmonic Mean (HM) 
  Finds the reciprocal of the average of reciprocals.
### Mode 
 Identifies the most frequently occurring value.
### Median 
 Determines the middle value when data is sorted.
## Testing
Successfully ran tests ensuring all five functions work as intended.
Verified there were no errors, warnings, or notes during package checks.
